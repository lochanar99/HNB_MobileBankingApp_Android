# HNB_MobileBankingApp_Android

This was a project that was given to us at SLLIT 3rd Year 2nd Semester for the UEE module. We had to redesign an application of our choice and enhance its user experience
according to the design principles taught.
We chose the HNB mobile banking application for this, you can find the redesigned interfaces by cloning the project
